Triple Triad League of Legends Edition
A card game based on the Final Fantasy VIII in game card game Triple Triad.

Each player has a hand of five cards and takes turns placing them on a 3x3 grid. Cards have a number on each of their sides from 0-9 or 'A' which is 10. To beat your opponent, place a card so that your cards value is higher than your opponents cards value on the sides that touch one another. When a card is beaten it is flipped and belongs to the player that beat the card. At the end of the game the player with the highest score wins

Motivation
@eliothowes1090 (contributor) and myself both loved playing the in game card game that was Triple Triad in the amazing Final Fantasy VIII

To explore what it was like to build a game and to further our knowledge and skills in JavaScript we decided to relive our childhood and create our own version styled and themed using my love of League of Legends
